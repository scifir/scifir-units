## Mass points

The **mass_point_3d\<T\>** class allows to do calculations of mass points in 3D spaces. The addition of mass points works as any mass point and gravity center of physics in 3D spaces. The template parameter T allows to specify the dimensions of the space. The mass has always his base dimensions in grams.
