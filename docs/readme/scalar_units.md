# Scalar units - scifir-units

Scalar units and vector units are the central objects of scifir-units. They store a value and a set of dimensions, as units on science do. Scalar units are just normal values, while vector units have a value and a direction to which the vector points to.

All scalar unit classes are either scalar_unit class or a child class of scalar_unit class, without vector_unit_2d, vector_unit_3d and vector_unit_nd possible cases for this definition.

Scalar unit classes have a fixed set of dimensions that can be changed to any equivalent set of dimensions, and can't be changed, because the scalar_unit class impedes it, to any set of dimensions that's not equivalent to the original dimensions. For example, a scalar unit class that has of dimensions "m" can't be changed to dimensions "Pa", but can be changed to dimensions "Ã…" (angstrom dimension). Dimensions can be changed whenever is wanted if an equivalent set of dimensions if more comfortable to do the calculations than the original dimensions the scalar unit class has been instantiated with.

Derived scalar unit classes have a fixed set of dimensions. For example, length classes have dimension "m", and mole classes have dimension "mol". Pressure class has dimension "Pa", etc.

Scalar units can operate with other scalar units, as well as with numeric primitive types. Functions like abs(), sqrt() and to_string() are supported. They have functions to operate with strings, and functions to operate with streams.

Scalar units can have any dimension of the SI system of units, or, also, any **custom dimension**. A custom dimension is a dimension with an arbitrary name, which is commonly used inside some fields of science when there's no name for a needed dimension.

An example of use of scalar_unit is the following:

```cpp
length x = 10_m;
length y = length(8,"mm");
length z = length("10 m");
area xy = area(100,"m2");

x = 2_m;

length a = x + 3.2_dm;
length e = x - 1_mm;
area b = y * 3_m;
length c = b / 2_m;

x += 1_km;
y -= 50_cm;

length f = a + 1.5;
length g = b - 7;
length h = c * 3;
length i = c / 1.5;
area j = c ^ 2;

f += 2;
f -= 1;
g *= 1.5;
h /= 5;

x++;
y--;

x.change_dimensions("mm"); // Dimensions can be set to any prefix
x.change_dimensions("s"); // An scalar_unit can't change to other dimensions different than the dimensions they started

if (x.has_dimensions("km")) // Dimensions are compared without prefixes
{}

x.change_dimensions(y); // Now x has dimensions "mm" as y

ostringstream out;
out << x; // scalar_unit classes can operate with streams

cout << x.display(); // Displays the scalar_unit up to 2 decimal digits with his dimensions
cout << x.custom_display("sci"); // Displays the scalar_unit in scientific notation without prefixes for any of his dimensions

length w = 100_m;
string d = to_string(w); // Creates the string "100 m"

float a = abs(x); // abs() gives the absolute value of the scalar_unit
scalar_unit b = sqrt(x*y); // sqrt() gives the square root of the scalar_unit
scalar_unit c = pow(x,3); // Dimensions would be "m3"

if (x.has_dimensions(y)) // Evaluates to true if the two scalar_unit objects have the same dimensions, independent of prefixes
{}

if (x == y) // Evaluates to true if the scalar_unit objects have the same value and the same dimensions
{}

if (x == 3) // Compares by value, it's better to only compare scalar_unit. To use 3_m instead would have been better, but numeric primitive types are allow to be used
{}

length a;
cin >> a; // There's support for input streams

string a;
a += x; // Adds the scalar_unit to the string

string b = "x: " + x;
string c = x + " value";
```

A base and a derived unit is a child class of scalar_unit class or of one of the vector unit classes (which are vector_unit_2d, vector_unit_3d and vector_unit_nd). A base and a derived unit adds always in his name a suffix **_2d**, **_3d** or **_nd**, if they inherit from vector_unit_2d, vector_unit_3d or vector_unit_nd, respectively.
