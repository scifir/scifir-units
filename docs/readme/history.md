# History of units of measurement

The first units of measurement have been created in the **prehistory**, by the **summerians**.

The current units of measurement are part of the **SI system of units**, created by the **International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM)**. Some units of measurement have been created by other organizations, like the **International Astronomical Union**. Some scientists have created some of the units of measurement, outside organizations.

Previous to the SI system of units were the **English units**, replaced later by the **Imperial units**. The Imperial units change some previous English units, and maintain the other units. Previous to the English units was the **apothecaries' system**. The apotecharies sysetem includes the pound, the grain, the ounce, among other units, and the English system of units and, later, the Imperial system of units, have added those units from it.

Each country has had his own system of units of measurement, or his own definition of it. Those system nowadays have been mainly replaced by the SI system of units.
