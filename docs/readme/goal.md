# Goal

The **goal of scifir-units** is to create a very good library of all units of measurement to be used inside any scientific software, which are electronics software, desktop software, command-line applications, or any other. That's the reason of why C++ is the programming language used for scifir-units. To provide all optimizations and features needed, in order to create a library **as good and complete** as possible, is an objective that has been achieved inside this project, as the user can judge looking at the reference.

scifir-units is intended to be **basal to develop scientific software**, of any kind, and to provide a solution for all common scientific calculations involving scalar units, vectors, coordinates, among other common math operations. The space has been supported for the 1D, the 2D, the 3D and even the ND case. Then, the problem of doing lots of calculus in scientific software has its difficulty reduced a big amount.
